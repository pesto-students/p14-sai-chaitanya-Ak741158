    <p>I'm Nobody&#33; Who are you&#63;<br>
        Are you &#45; Nobody &#45; Too&#63;<br>
        Then there's a pair of us&#33;<br>
        Don't tell&#33; They'd banish us &#45; you know&#33;</p>
    <p>How dreary &#45; to be &#45; Somebody&#33; <br>
        How public &#45; like a Frog &#45; <br>
        To tell one's name &#45; the livelong June &#45; To an admiring Bog&#33;</p>
    <p><i>By Emily Dickinson (1891)</i></p>
